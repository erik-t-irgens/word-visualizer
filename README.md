# Word Visualization

#### _An application intended to allow users to search for relevant words related to their initial search, intended to display this information with data visualization libraries and frameworks. Jan 24, 2020_

#### _By **Erik Irgens**_

## Description

This application is designed to accomplish the following, in short: 
1. Allow the user to submit a term and retrieve Synonyms, Antonyms, Associated words, and Rhymes of the initial query term
2. Allow the user to browse these results in a dynamic way, using both sigma.js and react-vis data visualizations libraries.
3. Dynamically alter the view of the data visualization by adding nodes, removing nodes, and altering the layout of the nodes displayed.



## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/erik-t-irgens/word-visualization
    ```
2. Install the dependencies
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```
3. Run the application in the root directory
    ```
    $ npm start
    ```
4. If ```$ npm start``` doesn't automatically direct you to your default browser, visit the MVC localhost:3000/
    ```
    localhost:3000/
    ```
## Technologies Used
* JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Node, yarn, react-vis, sigma.js, Semantic UI React

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
